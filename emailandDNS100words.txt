An email is transmitted from it’s origin machine to an outgoing mail server using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol which defines a return path, the intended recipients, and the data to be transmitted. The outgoing mail server consults a Domain Name Server, “a server dedicated to being a gigantic lookup table,” (Sarah, Lecture 5 video) which provides routing information allowing the mail to reach its destination server, which will use the information contained in the email header to place it in the appropriate location in that domain’s mail server.  The recipient computer can then retrieve that email from the mail server.
