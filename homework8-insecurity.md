Electronic Voting Machines
--------------------------



regarding WinVote machines used in Virginia elections:

• Winvote’s machine runs a version of Windows XP that hasn’t had patches installed since 2004 — four years before AVS deservedly went out of business.

• Its wireless network is “safeguarded” with insecure WEP encryption — and the password is abcde.

• The Windows admin password is (no, I’m not making this up) admin.

• Windows file-sharing is left on.

• The machine tracks votes using an obsolete version of Microsoft Access, in which the unencrypted database file is “protected” with a five-character password that a security tool cracked in seconds. (That password — shoup — apparently refers to a voting-machine company with a history of criminal indictments.)

• The system doesn’t log changes to that file.

• You can’t turn off the WiFi; if you remove the wireless card, the device won’t boot.
