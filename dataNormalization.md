*Data Normalization Problem - For the purposes of this exercise I will approach this as a paragraph about a problem inherent to the idea and practice of data normalization rather than a specific 'problem' or example where data normalization has been or should be applied.*  	

Normalization of a database is meant to standardize and make uniform the data called upon by queries (e.g. a customer contact file).  If a business that does most of it's transactions domestically separates each unique customer from the customer's location_country and then joins those tables for every query returning a customer address, an extra table would be joined in the name of saving space, which is cheap, rather than time, which is not. The example business could choose to include this repeated information that does not often change on the unique customer record for the purpose of returning queries faster.
